title: A Faith/Community Journey to Choosing a Software Job
---

I just decided on my next software job, and I have an immense sense of peace about my decision.  I'd like to share about the extended time I spent to reflect and decide -- so that you won't just rush to the next big name / hot startup / highest paying job, but really aim to make a values-based career decision you'll be at peace with.  I'll share about my values of relationship and "love your neighbor", how they came to influence my decision process, and how they apply to the software world.

## What Led Up to this Point

First of all, we who get to work as software developers are incredibly blessed.  In general we get paid very well and are in high demand for jobs where we spend the majority of our time solving interesting problems and creating.  It is easy to get caught in the Silicon Valley pecking order of, hey I don't work at Facebook or Pinterest or on the coolest technology, but as someone who lives in a place where there's almost nobody in high tech, I can tell you -- we are all looked at as rocket scientists by the rest of the world.

That said, here is a really brief summary to give all my readers some context.  I am an electrical engineer by training, who migrated into software largely due to the luck of landing a job at VMware.  I joined them when they were less than 200 people, stayed 9 years and left when they ballooned to over 10,000.  It was a crazy ride.  Next I jumped to the big data analytics team at Ooyala, a video SaaS company (Software as a Service).  Thanks to the great folks there, I got introduced to the world of open source and speaking at conferences, opening many doors for me.  Next I went over to Socrata, to help the open data and government transparency movement.  It was a great mission, but things didn't work out -- it became clear my values and career goals were in conflict with where the company was -- and I longed to get back to doing big data analytics.  In addition, there were some open source projects I was maintaining in my spare time, and I really wanted to have support for them.

## Relax, Be Patient, Give up Twitter

At first, my instinct was to go talk to as many friends as possible, former bosses, etc., and think about some of the big names in the Big Data space I was in.  I wondered though, if I should consider going in a different direction, like consulting.  All wrapped up in my own thinking, it was actually friends and my wife who made me slow down.  They asked me a question that cut to my heart: "Where's God in all this?"  They worried, correctly, that I was too self-consumed, and didn't have my heart in the right place.

I didn't grow up Christian, and amongst most Christians I knew there was a sense that for things like jobs, one had to rely on one's own wisdom.  That seemed like worldly wisdom though.  Unsatisfied, I talked to more spiritual folks, started reading Experiencing God, and realized that I had to be patient and really carve out quality spiritual time.  If you really love someone, you would want to spend time with them, to hear them out for real.  I decided it was time to do that for God.  What time did I have?  The mornings.  A while back I had decided to get up earlier - but mostly to get more time for things like open source development.  It didn't really work - it's hard to wake up earlier, and I would end up surfing the web, checking Facebook to see how many like's I got, and wasting time on Twitter.  Somehow I got inspired to quit Twitter for a month, and started really dedicating my mornings - to prayer, journaling, reading, listening to sermons, just really good quiet time.  After a while I started by listening to worship songs too.  And you know what -- it worked.  Relationships and spirituality tends to return what your heart puts into them.

After some time, I decided it was better to quit and just enjoy the summer.  Life is short, and summers where I live is absolutely gorgeous.

I know many of you reading this might not believe in a God, but that's OK.  I hope you keep reading!  My point is this - job decisions are very important.  Take the time to make them, and take some time off to enjoy life.  Spend time with your family, parents, kids, God, people who matter.  This will also help put the right perspective into your decision that only time and reflection can do.  And I'm sorry, there are no shortcuts to this.  Relationships take time.  Perspective takes time.  Peace takes time.  Employers are not as important as any of those things.

## Money Last

The first thing God gave me peace about was money.  You see, I grew up in a culture where you live to work, harder and harder, to rise up the ladder in importance and salary.  As an engineer in Silicon Valley, I graduated seeking the companies who paid the best, and switched jobs seeking to increase pay.  Being the sole bread winner of a family with kids and a mortgage doesn't decrease the pressure.

Somehow, in the last few months, I have been freed from that mentality.  God told me, just trust Me.  I started connecting with startups in Asia that were not VC-funded, and found a way to sustain themselves and be very long-term thinking.  Consulting firms that may never go IPO, but who strongly believe in investing in the growth of their people.  I started to realize how the startup culture in Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) -- every aspect from hiring practices to management to short-term focus to how we deal with community -- is driven by VC money and everything that that implies.  No doubt that has produced a huge industry and uncountable life-changing innovations, but we need to be cognizant of all the ill effects as well.

I basically came to realize that other values - relationships and community, for me -- were much more important and worth sacrificing salary for.

## Relationships: Software is a People Business

Sometimes in the software world, we forget just how much of a people business it still is.  We grill interview candidates with coding challenges usually irrelevant to our daily work and try to hire the most "brilliant" minds without giving most candidates a chance to really get to know the people they might work with.  We pick companies based on their potential for financial reward and look at which VC funded those companies, or on what we can learn or what technologies we get to work on.

Looking back, I realized that most of my important career inflection points were due to relationships gifted from God.  I joined VMware thanks to a friend from college.  Open source and conferences were due to working for a tech lead who became a great friend.  What's more, it is known that VCs care not so much for ideas but for strong teams.  We all know that the people we influence the most tend to be those with whom we've built the strongest relationships.

The above was probably something I realized before, but just had not applied to choosing software jobs.  I realized:
- Being able to work for somebody you know (say your ex-boss) is a no-brainer.  They know to look out for your interests.
- I really didn't want to do traditional interviews.  Your coworkers are people you will have tons of meetings with, who influence your happiness for 40 hours a week at least.  Why not work with people you know, instead of guessing what they might be like through a 1 hour interview?
- Work with people who believe in you, instead of people to whom you constantly need to prove yourself. (I must credit this to @susielee on Twitter)

I decided to take a step of faith and stay with friends or people I knew when I travelled to conferences (when possible) instead of hotels.  In June I went to Spark Summit, and stayed at friends' places.  I had a blast and got great advice from my friends as well.  For me, it was an important confirmation that personal relationships should play a key role in my decision.

do not chase $ and control; both are illusions -- chase relationships.
- I should start my own business.  Well no.  Don't.  Find a strong team first.

African proverb quote.

Doing things together - what does that mean?   It's all about team.  Don't get so caught up in self.
- Important to know who you'll be working with.  What are their values?

## Loving Your Neighbor (and the Open Source Community)

Why feel community important - blessings of church community, neighbors as we moved up. Swing dance community.

My community - the open source community.
- So easy to take open source for granted
- How I participate in OSS
- Many ways to help the community - contributing back code, helping organize events, conference reviews, open sourcing innovative new stuff.... but also: being an expert in existing popular things, sharing knowledge
- Joining a team that truly loves open source and the community
- Where helping the community is a business benefit, not a liability

Confirmation partly through reading Every Good Endeavor.  Changed my understanding - Ruth and the Temple, what is our temple?

## Consulting vs Product Development

## Putting it all together, or letting God decide

- Multiple confirmations: word, prayer, circumstances, friends
