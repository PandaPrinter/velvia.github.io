I like to think of myself as an artist.  Whether behind the camera lens, or leading dance moves on the floor, or creating next-generation distributed systems, aesthetics and purpose are important to me, as well as community.

### Open Source Projects

These are all projects I created or co-created, and I maintain most of them... when time allows :)
